## For GNOME user 🐾
Please also check my new project [Hanabi](https://github.com/jeffshee/gnome-ext-hanabi)! While the project is still in its infancy, it has the potential to become more integrated with GNOME Shell

## Features 🔥

There are several solutions to achieve video as wallpaper on Linux, for example:

1. [Xwinwrap + mpv](https://www.linuxuprising.com/2019/05/livestream-wallpaper-for-your-gnome.html)
2. [Komorebi](https://github.com/cheesecakeufo/komorebi)

Hidamari offers similar feature as above, with additional features listed below:

- [x] Autostart after login
- [x] Apply static wallpaper with blur effect <sup>1</sup>
- [x] Detect maximized window and fullscreen mode <sup>2</sup>
- [x] Volume control
- [x] Mute/Pause the playback anytime with just 2 clicks!
- [x] I'm feeling lucky <sup>3</sup>
- [x] Hardware accelerated video decoding! <sup>4</sup>
- [x] Gnome Wayland support!
- [x] Multi-monitor support!
- [x] Streaming URL support! <sup>5</sup>
- [x] Webpage as wallpaper! <sup>6</sup>
- [ ] You name it! =)

<sup>1</sup> Video frame can be applied as system wallpaper, look great in <i>GNOME</i> (currently GNOME exclusive, support for other DE might be added if requested...)  
<sup>2</sup> Automatically pauses playback when maximized window or full screen mode is detected (currently X11 only...)  
<sup>3</sup> Randomly select and play a video  
<sup>4</sup> Use <i>vlc</i> as backend (currently HW acceleration doesn't work with Nvidia+Wayland combination...)     
<sup>5</sup> Use <i>yt-dlp</i> as backend, tested with YouTube videos  
<sup>6</sup> Theoretically it can be anything from a normal webpage to <i>Unity/Godot WebGL games</i>, be creative!
